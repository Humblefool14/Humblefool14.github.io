What are Q-bits ?

I don't want to start my blog with huge descriptions or unnecessary formalism. 

Q-bits are the fundamental units of Quantum computing. 
Bits are the fundamental units of digital computing.1 and 0 are the classical bits
Similar to that, Qubits are fundamental units.The similarity ends here. 

Q-bits differ entirely from the classical bits used for computation. 
Q-bits are built by exploiting the properties of an atom.
